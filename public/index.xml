      <description>&lt;p&gt;PhishMe, a security behavior management company based out of Virginia, released their &lt;a href=&#34;http://phishme.com/phishme-q1-2016-malware-review/&#34;&gt;First Quarter of 2016 Malware Report&lt;/a&gt;. The report begins by laying out the relative scale of phishing in the beginning of 2016, stating that there has been a 6.3 million email increase in global phishing which translates to a 789% increase (pg. 3, first paragraph).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the emails which were analyzed, there was a significant increase in the amount of ransomware that was distributed. PhishMe reports that currently 93% of all phishing emails are attempting to deliver ransomware, often the Locky (originally detected by Symantec as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2016-021706-1402-99&#34;&gt;Trojan.Cryptolocker.AF&lt;/a&gt; â€” &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/locky-ransomware-aggressive-hunt-victims&#34;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) variant.&lt;/p&gt;
